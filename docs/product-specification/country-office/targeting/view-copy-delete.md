## Motivation

The purpose of this section is to allow HCT users to draw up potential scenarios with realistic data in order to prepare Cash Plans against a target population of households and individuals. To have better informed Cash Plans, users must see what potential Target Criteria results may have. Many times, users will need to manage their Target Populations, therefore a need to copy or delete existing Target Populations is a feature detailed in the Specifications below. 

## Feature Specifications

In this section, we will review the details of a Target Population.
