# Detail screen / approval process

**Feature details**: [https://unicef.visualstudio.com/ICTD-HCT-MIS/\_boards/board/t/Software%20Engineering/Features/?workitem=50071](https://unicef.visualstudio.com/ICTD-HCT-MIS/_boards/board/t/Software%20Engineering/Features/?workitem=50071)

### Motivation

HCT must be able to view on the system interface the information that is being ingested into the system in order to validate whether or not it is acceptable to be merged into the golden database. This is done by displaying the imported data on screen via the Details screen. Details on this screen will look similar in format and style to what is seen in the Populations Household/Individual details screen, however it will not be connected to the same database whatsoever. Lastly, once the information is reviewed on the interface, HCT users will have the option to approve the data file being examined before allowing it to merge with the golden records.

### Data Source

All the data shown will be from the Registration DataHub \(except maybe when de-duplication is involved?\).
