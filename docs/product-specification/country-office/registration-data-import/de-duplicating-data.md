# De-duplicating data

The goal of de-duplicating data is not to have duplicate households and individuals in the HCT MIS database.

### What is a duplicate?

It could be either:

* duplicates between the same import
* duplicate of some household already in the population \(HCT-MIS' golden DB\).

### Algorithm for finding duplicates

Attributes we care about:

* National ID
* Unicef ID
* Names
* DOB
* Number of people in household.
* Geographical location of individuals in the household.

### Handling duplicates

### Preservation of Data

As required by the Data Agreements, the system is required to keep records of the following information:

* x
* y
* z





### Issues

* How to handle N-way duplicate management?
