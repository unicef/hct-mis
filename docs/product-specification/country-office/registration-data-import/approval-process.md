  option to approve the data file being examined before allowing it to merge
  with the golden records.

# Approval Process

## Motivation

HCT must be able to restrict the information that is being ingested into the system in order to validate whether or not it is acceptable to be merged into the golden database. To do this, HCT-MIS only allows certain users privilege to merge imported data to the golden records from the staging environment. To further ensure this process is done with intention, the privileged users will have to interact with the various interface prompts described below
