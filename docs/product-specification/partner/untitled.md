## Organization

### RACI

#### **Responsible:**

**Accountable:**

**Consult:**

**Informed:**

## **R.6 Registration Module**

* Minimum required \(CORE\):
  * Household:
    * **Core**
    * _Baseline_
  * Individual:
    * **PII** - Collected only for Focal Point \(ie: Head of Household\)
    * **Vulnerabilities / Demographics**
    * _Baseline_

## Requirement:

* **R.7** - Ability to add custom fields.
* Ability to edit content on forms.
* Ability to make custom field a child of another field \(previous field\).
* Specific to the Programme Level
* **R.8** - Mobile ready and Accessible, Responsive, 
* **R.9** - Self-service Authentication Management
  * Online first, then can go offline.
  * Both Unicef and Partners to authenticate. 
* **R10** - Offline Sync Capabilities:
  * Wifi / 3G data connection.
  *  Class 1 confidentiality
  * Ability based on R/P of user to pull Ben. Data.
* **R11** - Function Offline in Low-Bandwidth Situation
  * Delete locally stored beneficiary data after the devices receives confirmation from the server as sync completes.
* **R35** - Unique IDs
* **R12** - Biometrics
  * Stored on SmartChip

### RISKS:

* Changing criteria mid-program may cause issue with data\(?\)
* Online/Offline Sync Data duplication - Manual Sync vs. Auto Sync.
* Duplicate Households being registered.
  * Check if already in system.
  * Offline will not be able to check.
    * Perhaps associate \(link\) to existing Household.
* Importing Govt list could prove difficult - would just need to add source data as custom fields - _See data mgmt_
* Criteria for creating new Intervention - to avoid collecting all data under a single intervention.
* Common data criteria imported...

### IDEAS:

* Note on registration for suggested aide - IE: Visit is for Nutrition - but notice no water.

After 1 year's time, the fields will need to be reviewed for updating.

Focal Points will need a secondary \(representative\) member appointed.

Representatives of focal point may not be a part of the household. Need to identify this.

#### Household Vulnerabilities

* See Data Lake - Data Dictionary
* Fields will be a pick list.

#### Household Baseline

* 1/15 families surveyed should be set as baseline criteria.

#### Save Form

* Ability to save draft of form before saving.

Interventions

* Bens. need to be recorded in a way to prevent duplication among households
* **No-Pay List** - Beneficiaries listed as already receiving funds. Similar to a blacklist.

#### Household ID

#### Individual ID

#### Identification Document Type

### Suggestions:

* **O**pen **D**ata **K**it
