# Open Questions

## Questions from Ngum - Fri Sep 20:

One of the most pressing issues we are trying to address is the underlying HCT MIS Data infrastructure \(Data lake/Databases\). We are therefore going to allocate 25% of Monday's meeting time to discuss on this topic.

* _Sounds good..._

[3:24 PM](https://tivix.slack.com/archives/CMSM0S7BN/p1569007464024400)[@sumit](https://tivix.slack.com/team/U025EUUSM) and the team, Claire and internal Stakeholders will therefore like you to explain how you plan on developing the underlying data infrastructure of the entire HCT MIS. \(Any information you can on how you thing communication shall be done with internal UNICEF systems \(mainly the VISION ERP\) and external Systems \(mainly Cash Assist\) shall also be very useful\)

* _**Plan on developing HCT-MIS:** See "how to develop HCT-MIS" section below...._
* _**Internal Communication:** Ideal to have direct communication with VISION - invite to slack or email is fine. Developers will need to be able to set up direct conversations with VISION's team in order to not be blocked on development. It's key to identify VISION's availability in the coming months for assistance and support._ 
* _**External Communication:** Similar to VISION, it would be ideal to have a representative Tivix team can openly communicate with in order to not be blocked. If none is available, Tivix will resort to logging issues in Clubhouse and posting blockers as necessary while relying on Unicef team to resolve any gaps in information._

[3:26 PM](https://tivix.slack.com/archives/CMSM0S7BN/p1569007560024600)Any information on how you intend getting the job done or your vision of what needs to  be done shall be very useful for that session.

* **How to develop HCT-MIS:**
  * _Scaffold the project in GitHub \(done\)_
  * _Confirm data model for core development._
  * _Build core components such as user, interventions, cycles, attributes, payments, etc._
  * _Confirm assumptions and further elaborate on core components to date._
  * _Documenting Functional Spec in GitBook_ 
    * _Signing off on Spec before tasks enter Dev. sprint / Iteration._
  * _Track core components - ie: Modules, being completed in ClubHouse._
    * _Weekly \(or Bi-weekly\) Touch Base meetings with entire Project Team to show progress._
  * _Maintain QA through appropriate DevOps and Automated Testing system \(Cypress / Selenium\)._
  * _Passed features will move to the appropriate environments to be added to UAT environment._
  * _Identify Pilot Users for initial testing and validation \(managed by Unicef\)._
  * _Pilot Launch._
  * _Go Live._ 

[3:27 PM](https://tivix.slack.com/archives/CMSM0S7BN/p1569007653025700)NB// We'll be limited to a 15 minute discussion on the topic but whatever you present or share shall help our internal brainstorming sessions

* Okay

The last point for Monday's meeting which goes to [@brandin.lewis](https://tivix.slack.com/team/U7QGCVDGD) is on **expectations**. We'll aIso like you to share what your expectations are from UNICEF vis-a-vis the updates and deliverables you share \(such as the UX deliverables and others to come\) and any other expectations.

* _UX Deliverables will be shared by midweek next week for Unicef's review. During which time, Unicef will consult amongst themselves and w/ Tivix for clarity, consolidate their feedback in preparation for development of V2 of Clickable Mockups._
* _Other deliverables will be shared out similarly in the following weeks for review and consolidated feedback._
* _Iteration 2 will be where Tivix & Unicef work closer together to take what was developed as groundwork in Iteration 1 to be refined for development in later iterations._
