# Change Request

## Overview:

### Change Details:

Unicef has made the request to include in the development of the Target Population for Iteration 4; the ability to have HCT system interact with the Corticon RuleEngine in order to produce a Vulnerability Score, along with a few other scores \(_amount not yet determined_\).

### Change Reason

Upon recent discussion and thought, it was decided to include additional criteria that can only be established by the Corticon RuleEngine, at this time. These additional criteria, including Vulnerability Score is considered to be a fundamental business requirement . It's previous consideration was overlooked until now. 

### Impact of Change

Overall the Impact this change brings is relatively small. See below for the list of impacts this change brings:

* Slight Adjustments to the backend that have already been created since the start of Iteration 4 \(roughly 4.5 weeks\).
* Significant Design Adjustments to the affected flow of the Target Population process from which it was originally prepared for.
* Slight refactoring of the Front End, including updated styles, components, new components and more.
* General Impact for overall timeline project or iteration timeline is **small**.
* Some deliverables identified for Iteration 4 will need to be placed on hold or moved to be developed at a later time.

### Proposed Action

The agreed action is to move forward with placing the following two features from the Iteration 4 SOW on hold:

1. CO users to be able to view flex fields somewhere in the interface.
2. POC of Kobo DevOps and documentation refinements, API usage needed etc. Technical support from Kobo on DevOps, database structure, API related help may be required.

## **Iteration 4 Checklist:**

### **Product / Project Management Deliverables**

### **Technical Deliverables**

* **✓** **-** Implementation of **Population** Tab
* **✓** **-** **Registration data import** of household/individual data as scoped, including data by **Excel**, including the excel template download based on core / flex fields for households and individuals. Kobo and duplicate data management to be handled later.
* **✓** **-** Implementation of **Target Population** Module, allowing users to create new target populations and the associated approval process needed for it.
* **X -** _**CO users to be able to view flex fields somewhere in the interface.**_
* **X -** _**POC of Kobo DevOps and documentation refinements, API usage needed etc. Technical support from Kobo on DevOps, database structure, API related help may be required.**_
