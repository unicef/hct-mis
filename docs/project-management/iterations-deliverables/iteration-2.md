# Iteration 2



**The overall goal of this iteration is to be ready for agile development sprints starting iteration 3.**

####  **Product / Project Management Deliverables**

The goal of Iteration Two is to refine, elaborate and finalize on our current understanding of the entire projectâ€™s components \(Modules\) with emphasis on CashAssist/Rule-engine integration, Registration, HQ Dashboard and Country User Flows.  
****

* Start initial functional level conversations on integration with CashAssist and other UNHCR systems.
* User Persona finalization/elaboration for the system. This will mostly be complete by iteration 1.
* Finalize/elaborate the roles and permissions matrix for all user personas who will use the HCT MIS platform.
* Demo the mockups and overall specification/strategy for HCT-MIS functional implementation to one or two country offices which we would be piloting in. Any gathered feedback will be documented and then included in the scope for any future iterations or development sprints. It may involve depending on availability etc. an in-person workshop with a Country Office \(CO\) to validate direction as well if UNICEF thinks it would be useful.
* Elaborate on documentation in Gitbook and ensure that its delivered at the end of iteration with content which is reflective of all the deliverables in this iteration, whether embedded in it or linked to the right external resource.
* Plan out iteration 3 stories for sprint 1 of development along with proposing the deliverables of iteration 3.

####  **Technical Deliverables**

During this iteration, Tivix will continue to refine the architecture documentation, finalize architecture of the platform and build upon the scaffolded code-base further.  


* Firm up and finalize the integration details with CashAssist in collaboration with UNHCR and UNICEF ICTD teams. This includes details of any data integration, API calls, data lake \(if any\) etc. Details of these would be fully documented and be in a state to be signed off by all concerned parties by the end of this iteration.
* Attend and participate in technical discussions Workshop with UNHCR + UNICEF teams in Geneva.
* Finalize/elaborate technical implementation details of the registration module including choices around native, hybric, react native or PWA as implementation options for the applications along with their pros / cons.
* Finalized canonical data model at the field level and elaborated method of handling custom/flex fields for households and beneficiaries.
* Get CI/CD in place for the platform along with a dev. environment in the chosen cloud provider \(Azure\) up at eg. [https://dev-hct-mis.unicef.org/](https://dev-hct-mis.unicef.org/) or similar.

####   ****

#### **UX / UI Design Deliverables**

Tivix will continue with the UX / Interfaces developed in Iteration 1 and continue to refine them.  


* Finalized User Flows, specifically for Country User Roles and Identified Core User Personas.
* Finalized Site/Product map for all user personas. This may be delivered via a Miro board or similar to foster and ensure collaboration and distribution of the content.
* Clickable Mockups \(v2\) covering all core modules including identifying in the best possible manner where/when the integration with CashAssist occurs for the user. This will be delivered via Invision.
* Finalized mockups for whatever modules/functionalities we will be focusing on from a development standpoint in iteration 3.
