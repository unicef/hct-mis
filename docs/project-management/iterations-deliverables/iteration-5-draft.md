##  **Technical Deliverables**

* Complete development of any further Core Fields changes from Iteration 4.
* CO users to be able to view flex fields somewhere in the interface.
* POC of Kobo DevOps and documentation refinements, API usage needed etc. Technical support from Kobo on DevOps, database structure, API related help may be required.
* -------------------------------------
* Deliver a helm chart that can be deployed on Azure environments of HCT \(dev/staging/uat/prod\).
* Work to make the helm chart be potentially public available / maintained then by the open-source community or the Kobo team.
* Leverage the Kobo service setup via this helm package then, to interface with the HCT MIS system.
* Nice to have: helm chart tested and working in AWS environment as well. AWS is something that the Kobo team leverages and might find useful long-term.



## **UX / UI Design Deliverables**

* **Design final prototype of Registration Data Import Enhancements \(Deduplication\)**
* **Design final prototype of Payment Verification Tab**
* _Design final prototype of Grievances & Feedback Tab_
* Continued refinement of V 3.X mockups. Delivery of V.4.X of mockups to help understanding of elaboration efforts for remaining modules \(deduplication process, payment verification, grievances & feedback, dashboards, user management etc.\)
* Demo / webinar for peer review with country offices \(if feasible\).
