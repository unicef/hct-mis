# Definition of Ready/Done

## Definition of Ready

To align the team on expectations for building new features, it is important to be consistent with the definition of ready. 

Tickets are created as pieces of functionality to support a larger goal. Tickets should always include the following:

* Clear understanding of what is to be done
* Descriptive title
* Use Case / description
* Acceptance criteria
* Validation rules 
* Links to specifications / designs as appropriate

Establish team understanding that as each person accepts a ticket to work on, they are taking ownership of the full quality of the deliverable. PMs will do their part to make the ticket clear but the engineer is ultimately responsible for the critical thinking and high quality of their deliverables.

## Definition of Done

Here is our definition of done for features / stories:

* Acceptance criteria is met
* Documentation does exist
* Tests do exist
  * \*\*\*\*[**Unit Tests**](../technical-specification/development-setup/testing-strategy.md#unit-testing) for backend
  * functional / e2e tests where appropriate
* All tests must pass
* Code has been demoed on local or live\(dev/staging\) instance
* Code has been reviewed by one peer, for features / critical bug fixes
* Code meets coding guidelines
* Code is checked in
