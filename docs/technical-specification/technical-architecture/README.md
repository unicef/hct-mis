# Technical Architecture

### Breakup into various Services

The goal is to have separation of the user interfaces \(be it mobile / PWA or web application interface\) and backend logic.

The frontend will be a React based application leveraging UNICEF design philosophy that is built on top of Material Design.

The backend will be a Django and Python application, exposing a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API that leverages [Graphene](https://graphene-python.org).

### Application components / sub-components

These may or may not map 1:1 to the modules being speced.
