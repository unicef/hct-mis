# Open Issues

### UX

* How do we enable as seamless an experience with HCR.
* How to enable SSO with CA for users that have been on-boarded already?

### UNICEF HCT MIS data/flows in CashAssist

* Is HCT per country an app or workspace within dynamics?
* Is it the same codebase as HCR CashAssist or a fork of the codebase specific to UNICEF?
* Is each CO data be kept isolated and accessed that way by HCT MIS?

### Data Interchange

* REST / GraphQL ?
* Direct native Dynamics API access or through a CA layer?
* Data lake?
* What would be the best way to get household / beneficiary data from HCT MIS to CashAssist.
* How large are typical datasets? For cash plans etc.

### User Management

* User management / sync ?
* Mapping of user roles/permissions across systems \(at the UI level\)
* What do they use for user management ticketing system.
